                    <td class="text">Flight is a relatively simple move used to defend your stones from capture.
                        If you determine that your opponent is in a position to capture the stones in one of your cups,
                        you can prevent capture simply by emptying that cup and sowing. the stones.</td>

                        possible attack from your opponent.In this scenario, you may wish to set up a counter-attack
                        which would pose an immediate threat to the stones in your opponent's cups, forcing him to make
                        a defensive play rather than attacking you.</td>

                    <td>OverKill</td>
                    <td class="text">Overkill involves defending your threatened pit by altering your opponent's sowing
                        position. In this case, you can choose a pit from which to sow which will result in an extra
                        stone being added to your opponent's cup which threatens your stones.</td>

                    <td>Reinforcement</td>
                    <td class="text">Reinforcement involves a more indirect defensive play by making a threatened pit
                        ineligible for capture.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Raiding</td>
                    <td class="text">You capture a pit of the opponent's stones by placing the last stone in an empty
                        bin on your own side, directly across from the opponent's bin being raided.</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>Timing</td>
                    <td class="text">The timing of your strategies and tactics is essential. A good player can watch for
                        opportune times to unload too-full holes or can weigh that factor when deciding whether to
                        unwind a hoarding strategy. This also reduces the overhead cost of a looping maneuver.</td>
